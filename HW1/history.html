                <blockquote cite="http://www.cplusplus.com/info/history/">
                    In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with 
                    Classes to C++. The ++ operator in the C language is an operator 
                    for incrementing a variable, which gives some insight into 
                    how Stroustrup regarded the language. Many new features were 
                    added around this time, the most notable of which are virtual functions, 
                    function overloading, references with the & symbol, the const keyword, 
                    and single-line comments using two forward slashes (which is a 
                    feature taken from the language BCPL).
